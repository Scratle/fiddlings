### Stack Meta Off

Removes all traces of meta from

- The home page, both "Featured on Meta" and "Hot Meta Posts".
- Meta link from "CURRENT COMMUNITY" in the upper right hamburger menu.
- "Meta user"-link from user profiles.
- Meta achievements in the achievement dropdown.
- Inbox-elements from meta.

Note: It does not remove the inbox indicator. But it does remove the items once the inbox icon has been clicked. Likewise with achievements.

If one accidentally goes to a meta post, this will be the presented page:

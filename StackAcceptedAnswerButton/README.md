### Adds an indicator when there's an accepted Answer

The script will check the Question timeline for an accepted Answer. If it finds one, it will add a checkmark to the post title, as marked in red.

If this variable in the script is set to false:

```
const addToTitle = false;
```

the script will instead add a button next to the sorting filters, as marked in pink.

Clicking on the checkmark / button will take you directly to the Answer.

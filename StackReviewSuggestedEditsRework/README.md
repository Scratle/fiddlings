### How it works

Installing it will apply the default settings to reviews in the "Suggested edits" review queue on Stack Overflow.

To change the settings click on this icon on the top right:

![settings icon](https://i.stack.imgur.com/uXCbS.png)

..and a user interface<sup>1</sup> to change the settings will appear:

Note that changes to the setting will *not* be applied to the reviews until the page is refreshed.

### Make "Suggested Edits" reviews wider
..and choices for some other nice things:

- Remove the "Big Box" on the right 1/3 of the screen.
- Replace the radios with real buttons, like they used to be.
- Or keep the radios, but move them to allow for a wider review.
- Rework the title to not repeat information.
- Move the post type (Question / Answer / Tag Wiki) to the title bar.
- Move the post-diff choices (Inline/Side-by-side/Side-by-side Markdown) up next to the Filter-button.
- Add diff-choices on title/tag only edits.
- Move the daily review progress to the "Review task"-button
- Add back the user cards of both the author and previous editor.
- Get the statistics of the editor.
- Change the size and colour of the edit "comment", which is renamed to "summary".
- Make notifications more prominent.
- Remove the line trough on deleted content.
- Show user filters in compact form.
- Current or Stack Design new user cards and/or Stack Design moderator flair.

### How it works

Installing it will apply the default settings to reviews in the "Suggested edits" review queue on Stack Overflow.

To change the settings click on this icon on the top right:

![settings icon](https://i.stack.imgur.com/uXCbS.png)

..and a user interface<sup>1</sup> to change the settings will appear:

Note that changes to the setting will *not* be applied to the reviews until the page is refreshed.

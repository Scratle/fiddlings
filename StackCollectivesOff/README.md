### Stack Collectives™ Off

Removes almost all traces of Collectives™ on Stack Overflow:

- Tag-icons on posts. Both on the Questions themselves and on lists.
- Award icons & the orange affiliation banner on user cards on posts.
- Box under the user avatar on user profiles.
- List item saying "X user groups" on user profiles.
- Box in the home page right sidebar.
- Endorsements ("Answer recommended by ...").

It does not remove the Collectives™ link in the left sidebar and the Collectives™ themselves.
